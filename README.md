# Aurora
A modern, maintainable Multi-User Dungeon written in C#.

Back in 2009, I started a project to build an engine for a MUD not in C, but in C# with a SQL database backend. As was the style at the time, it was called MUDcat6006. Aurora is an effort to revive that project, but even more modernized and maintainable.
